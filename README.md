# AV-Interactions-City-Traffic
Low-speed automated shuttles, from EasyMile and Navya, were tested respectively in Montréal, Canada and in Candiac, Canada, in mid and late 2019. Trajectories were extracted from video footage using [TrafficIntelligence](https://bitbucket.org/Nicolas/trafficintelligence).

This repository provides samples of data from trajectories and interactions, captured from both test projects, that were used as part of this submitted [draft presentation](https://polymtlca0-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/etienne-2_beauchamp_polymtl_ca/EfqWJnm4OTJIl4rNwG8oCjMBisXtir48LfEU2-1B6sgjsA?e=eHEM2j).

## Installation
To get started clone this repository and install the required packages.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/FinestStone/AV-Interactions-City-Traffic.git
$ cd AV-Interactions-City-Traffic/
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
* The database samples are provided in the [data folder]().
* The [extraction folder]() presents examples on extracting information of interest from trajectories and interactions and storing it in a CSV file.
* Figures can be obtained similarly to what is presented in the [results folder]().
